# BoilerExam
I mainly used AI to check for certain bugs to make sure the code is running smoothly and for accuracy  
I used AI to help me label the peaks of the Deposit Rate vs. Campaign Contacts by pdays becuae I was not completely sure I remembered to do that correctly from my classes 
I also used AI to crossrefernce whether I was using the heatmap syntax correclty 
Lastly, I used AI to guide the way I should execute the binary code to show the impact of the who were over contacted
